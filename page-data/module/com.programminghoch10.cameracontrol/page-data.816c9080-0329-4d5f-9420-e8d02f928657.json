Install the module on a system with a running XPosed framework\n1. Activate the module and select apps you want to limit camera access to.\n\n### How to configure:\n\n- Route 1:\n    - Go back to the module list\n    - Long press on `CameraControl` and select App Info\n    - On the bottom, click on `Advanced`\n    - Click on `Additional settings in the app`\n- Route 2:\n    - Go into device settings\n    - Click on apps\n    - Somehow tell the device to show all apps\n    - Select `CameraControl`\n    - On the bottom, click `Advanced`\n    - Click on `Additional settings in the app`\n- Route 3:\n    - Open up an ADB shell\n    - Run command `am start-activity com.programminghoch10.cameracontrol/.SettingsActivity`\n\nNow configure away!\n\n___Small intel:__ The configure activity is not accessible from the launcher, \nbecause LSPosed does not let modules hide their own launcher icons by default anymore. \nDefining a settings activity is an easy way to provide an accessible configuration interface, \nwithout forcing yet another launcher icon into the list.\nOne does not have to open the menu often anyways._\n\n### What it looks like\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png)\n","readmeHTML":"<h1>\n<a id=\"user-content-cameracontrol\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#cameracontrol\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>CameraControl</h1>\n<p>Next level camera management.</p>\n<p>CameraControl lets you manage access to your cameras depending on which side of the phone they face.</p>\n<p>Why?
