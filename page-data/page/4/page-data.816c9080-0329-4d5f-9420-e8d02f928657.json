So you can't screenshot your girlfriend's nudes.\n  (But that probably does not matter since you're reading this anyway)\n\n- Xposed Implementations Tested on:\n    - [EdXposed](https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXposed/)\n    - [LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/)\n\n- If you haven't noticed yet, this is a parody of [Disable-FLAG_SECURE](https://github.com/VarunS2002/Xposed-Disable-FLAG_SECURE) by [VarunS2002](https://github.com/VarunS2002).

Moved project from Eclipse to Android Studio\n2. Updated compile SDK version to use latest SDK (28)\n3. Updated dependencies to use online sources\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install this module you need the following apps and modules installed on your device:\n1. Magisk v18.1 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases\n2. Magisk Manager v7.0.0 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases\n3. Riru Magisk module v16.0 and above - https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru/releases\n4. EdXposed Magisk module v0.3.0.0_beta2 and above - https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXposed/releases\n5. EdXposed Installer v2.2.1 and above - https://github.com/solohsu/XposedInstaller/releases\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Some features are removed on purpose. Since GravityBox has been working on Samsung Oreo devices without much issues, I only implemented features that need special Samsung coding. You can check [GravityBox for Pie](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/app-gravitybox-v9-0-0-beta-1-android-9-t3908768) for additional features.\n- It could take some time to popup the root request, just wait a few minutes until it pops up, usually not much after the xposed installer recognized the module.\n\n## External Libraries\n\nThe project uses the following libraries:\n1. https://github.com/topjohnwu/libsu\n2. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge\n3. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedMods/tree/master/XposedLibrary\n4. https://github.com/jaredrummler/ColorPicker\n5.
